# Raycasting made in C
A very simple and lightweight raycast engine made with C and OpenGL. Only renders what's visible. And a map editor made with ncurses.

Control with WASD:
  * W to move foward
  * S to move backwards
  * A to turn left
  * D to turn right

To open the map editor, run `./mapper <file_path>` and run your raycaster with `./main <same_file_path>`.
